        <p>
          The IT department creates and administers all PHMO email addresses and domain accounts. Every new employee whose position requires them to use a computer or have access to IT resources on PHMO servers will be assigned a domain account and email account with appropriate login credentials at the time of employment.  HR must make an appropriate request for a new user setup to the IT department to set up a new user account.  All computer users must change passwords every 90 days.  Each user’s computer system will prompt them to change passwords automatically.  The IT department reserves the right to have users change their passwords at any time if the system has been compromised.
